# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is my D1 Project for the class CMPM 121 at UC Santa Cruz. In this game, you can click the fishing rod to collect fish and buy upgrades to earn yourself more fish yield. Knock yourself out!

Inspirations for UI:

[kaityln-png](https://github.com/kaitlyn-png/cmpm-121-f25-d1) - I was inspired by how this D1 project used different colored text and rounded highlighting to show how many upgrades were purchased. I was also inspired to implement a feature where the cursor is disabled or enabled while hovering over an upgrade depending on when the user either had not enough or enough to purchase it.

[mlau16](https://github.com/mlau16/cmpm-121-f25-d1/) - I took inspiration from this D1 project's sound effects. I think it gives the project more life due to having audible feedback rather than only visual feedback when interacting with the game. Instead of sound effects for clicking, I opted for every time the user clicks an upgrade. If the user is unable to upgrade, it gives a warning sound; if they are able to, a "cha-ching" sound is played instead.
